# Chienge

This Godot game was made during the Hitbox Makers' 0h game jam 2019 (available on itch.io)

The theme was "Dog or Monkey", and so you have to select which one is the most representated on each screen : the dog or the monkey?

You can see the game on [itch.io](https://zor-dev.itch.io/chienge)
